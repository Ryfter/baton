# Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-06-04
**Status:** Plans 1–11 shipped + Decision Loop + Cost Ledger. The entire post–Plan-8 backlog is cleared (issues #16–#26). See [`releases/2026-06-04-backlog-clearance.md`](releases/2026-06-04-backlog-clearance.md) for the full batch writeup and reasoning. This document parks remaining ideas so they have a recorded home and aren't carried in conversation memory.

Tracked as GitHub issues on **[Project #5: coding-agent-orchestrator](https://github.com/users/Ryfter/projects/5)**.

## Parked

The Tier 1–3 backlog (issues #16–#26) is **cleared** — see the Shipped table and
[`releases/2026-06-04-backlog-clearance.md`](releases/2026-06-04-backlog-clearance.md).
What remains:

- **Cross-project consolidation sweep.** Walk every project's decision history; promote patterns appearing in ≥2 projects to `universal/decision-guidance.md`. Wired (`/consolidate-decisions`) but **blocked** until a second project exists — universal guidance stays empty with a single project. No issue tracked.
- ~~**Wire `decision-detect` as a `Stop` hook.**~~ **Done 2026-06-05** — `scripts/hooks/decision-detect.ps1` is deployed to `~/.claude/hooks` and registered as a `Stop` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`; bootstrap now deploys + registers it for reproducibility. At end of each turn it scans the final message for decision phrasing and, on a hit, writes a review-ready intake draft to `$TEMP` (advisory — it doesn't auto-create the record; the orchestrator's two-step intake remains authoritative).

### Housekeeping ideas (no issue tracked yet)

- ~~Bootstrap should print a one-line "version vs. deployed" diff at startup.~~ **Done 2026-06-05** — Step 0 compares the repo's nearest `v*` tag against `~/.claude/.cao-version` (written on each deploy).
- ~~Refresh the bootstrap "Next steps" from the Plan-1 era to surface Plan 5/6/7/8 commands.~~ **Done 2026-06-05** — now lists dashboard, fleet/ensemble/six-hats/council, code phase, jobs+KB, projects+cost, and the consolidators.
- **Bootstrap hangs on `Read-Host` in non-interactive runs.** When a deployed file differs from the repo, `Copy-WithPrompt` prompts to overwrite; in a non-interactive/CI child process (incl. `test-bootstrap.ps1`) that blocks forever. Consider a `-NonInteractive`/`-AssumeNo` switch (or detecting `[Console]::IsInputRedirected`) so prompts default to "keep existing" instead of hanging.

## Decision records

Every architectural choice this session is captured under `~/.claude/knowledge/projects/coding-agent-orchestrator/decisions/`:

| ID | Topic |
|---|---|
| d001 | Cost ledger: per-project `cost.md` + `/cost` command |
| d002 | Plan 5b Six Hats — parallel role dispatch, no per-hat config |
| d003 | Plan 5c LLM Council — two rounds, peer-only critique, quorum 2, cap 5 |
| d004 | Plan 6 code phase — three commands, Agent worktree isolation, cherry-pick default |
| d005 | Plan 7 — read-only multi-project command center, hand-rolled YAML parsing |
| d006 | Plan 8 — local Ollama embeddings + numpy flat search; Python core with PS wrappers |
| d007 | Backlog execution as a fleet model-performance bench, tracked on Project #5 |
| d008 | Unattended dispatch = worktree-per-item + hard merge gate (orchestrator owns the merge) |
| d009 | Only agentic file-editing CLIs (codex, claude) implement; text-only models do research/review |
| d010 | Gated items merge per-item-branch → master; Gemini is the design/interface reviewer |
| d011 | Keep `nomic-embed-text` as the default KB embedding model (A/B vs `mxbai-embed-large`) |
| d012 | Fleet journal tags origin host as the dispatching machine (trailing field) |
| d013 | Ensemble cockpit surfaces partials by reading per-provider `.md` + `synthesis.md` |
